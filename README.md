Sample project to work on creating composite apps with the YUI App Framework. The idea is simple. Create a YUI App, create another app and as many more as you want. Then instead of creating the final app with Y.Base.create, use Y.App.create. This will allow you to create a new app that has merged views and routes. Base.create doesn't allow for that.

The actual project the extensions live in is the [YUI App Extensions Repo](https://github.com/Kevnz/yui-app-extensions)
